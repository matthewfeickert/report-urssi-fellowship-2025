# Matthew Feickert's 2025 URSSI Early-Career Fellowship Report

As part of inaugural US Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI) Early-Career Fellow Matthew Feickert's fellowship research, he developed an open source course on creating reproducible software environments for scientific and AI/ML applications.
The project "[Reproducible Machine Learning Workflows for Scientists](https://urssi.us/blog/2025/04/25/urssi-welcomes-first-early-career-fellows/)" focused on using the open source tool [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) to create version-controlled research environments with specialized hardware accelerator support.
In addition to performing research on creating robust reproducible hardware accelerated workflows with Pixi, Feickert organized and taught a pilot workshop at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison, a tutorial at the 2025 SciPy conference, and a national level workshop at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison.
